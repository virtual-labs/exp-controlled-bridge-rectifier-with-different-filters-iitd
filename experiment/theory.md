The controlled-bridge rectifier is shown in Fig. 1 feeding the power to the load. Due to rectifier operation the load voltage is rectified AC exhibiting high peak-to-peak ripple voltage. To reduce the peak-to-peak ripple it is necessary to connect low-pass filter circuits between bridge and load and they are: (a) C-filter, (b) L-filter and (c) LC-filter. Among these filter configurations, C-filter and LC-filter structures are effective in reducing the peak-to-peak content and hence their brief description is given in the following paragraphs.<br>

The capacitor filter is a cost-effective and widely used filter configuration. The diagram illustrating the configuration of the capacitor filter is shown in Fig. 2. The capacitor charges to the peak value of the input voltage and tries to maintain this level while the AC input decreases to zero. The capacitor will discharge through the load until the input voltage reaches to a level higher than the voltage across the capacitor. At this point, the rectifier will once again recharge the capacitor. The ripple voltage across the filter capacitor is a function of the filter capacitance value, AC supply frequency and the load current.<br>

The rectifier with LC-filter configuration incorporates an additional inductor between the rectifier and the capacitor filter. The inductor absorbs the ripple voltage and thus results in a smoothing effect leading to a decrease in the output voltage ripple as compared to the capacitor filter alone.
