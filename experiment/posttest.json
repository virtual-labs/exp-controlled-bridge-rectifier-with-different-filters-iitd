When the firing angle of a thyristor in a controlled rectifier circuit is increased, what happens to the average output load voltage?",
      "answers": {        
        "a": "It remains constant.",
        "b": "It increases.",
        "c": "It decreases.",

        "a": "Explanation 1",
        "b": "Explanation 2",
        "c": "Explanation 3: Increasing the firing angle will reduce the conduction time of the thyristors resulting in reduced output load voltage.",

      "question": "2. In a controlled rectifier circuit, what is the use of the firing angle control?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To adjust the ripple frequency of the output.",
        "b": "To control the output voltage.",
        "c": "To change the phase shift of the input AC voltage.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Explanation 1",
        "b": "Explanation 2: Changing the firing angle will change the conduction time of the thyristors and hence the output load voltage can easily be controlled.",

      "question": "3. What is the primary advantage of using an LC-filter over a C-filter in a controlled rectifier circuit?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "LC filter is simpler and more compact.",
        "b": "LC filters provide better ripple attenuation and improve the quality of the DC output.",
        "c": "LC filter is easy to design and implement.",
        "d": "LC filters allow higher ripple frequency compared to C filters."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Explanation 1",
        "b": "Explanation 2: Capacitive filter reduces the output voltage ripple. However, inductive filter reduces the output current ripple. Hence, ripple attenuation is more with LC filter.",
        "c": "Explanation 3",
        "d": "Explanation 4"

      "question": "4. What is the effect of increasing the load resistance in LC-filter based controlled bridge rectifier?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The filter’s ripple attenuation improves.",
        "b": "The capacitor’s charging time decreases.",
        "c": "The filter’s performance becomes unaffected.",
        "d": "The output voltage ripple increases due to decreased current through the inductor."
      },

        "a": "Explanation 1",
        "b": "Explanation 2",
        "c": "Explanation 3",
        "d": "Explanation 4: Increasing the load resistance will reduce the current through it and hence the ripple percentage will be higher."

        "a": "The ripple frequency increases.",
        "b": "The ripple frequency decreases.",
        "c": "The ripple frequency remains unchanged.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Explanation 1",
        "b": "Explanation 2",
        "c": "Explanation 3: Output ripple voltage frequency is independent of firing angle.",
